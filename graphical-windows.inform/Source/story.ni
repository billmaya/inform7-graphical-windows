When play begins:
	close the graphics window; [Since we're not using this window]
	open the map window;
	open the 1907-expedition window;
	open the 1926-expedition window;
	open the 1930-expedition window;
	draw Figure of Antarctic in map window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1907 in 1907-expedition window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1926 in 1926-expedition window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1930 in 1930-expedition window;
	draw Figure of HP-Lovecraft in the map window at x 50 and y 135 scaled to width 140 and height 170;
	draw Figure of Clemente-Onelli in the map window at x 50 and y 315 scaled to width 120 and height 190;
	draw Figure of Alice-Wilson in the map window at x 50 and y 500;
	draw Figure of Cystoidea in the map window at x 630 and y 30 scaled to width 275 and height 400;
	focus main window.

Every turn:
	draw Figure of Antarctic in map window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1907 in 1907-expedition window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1926 in 1926-expedition window;
	draw Figure of Miskatonic-1930 in 1930-expedition window;
	draw Figure of HP-Lovecraft in the map window at x 50 and y 135 scaled to width 140 and height 170;
	draw Figure of Clemente-Onelli in the map window at x 50 and y 315 scaled to width 120 and height 190;
	draw Figure of Alice-Wilson in the map window at x 50 and y 500;
	draw Figure of Cystoidea in the map window at x 630 and y 30 scaled to width 275 and height 400;
	focus main window.
